# Wind Power Forecasting - Application tool

This repository contains the source code of my Final Master's degree project in [Decision Systems Engineering](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/master/915-ingenieria-de-sistemas-de-decision), titled *Wind Power Forecasting using Machine Learning techniques*, coursed in Rey Juan Carlos University. For further information you can read the [dissertation](dissertation.pdf) (spanish).



## Introduction
This application is intented to be a flexible and configurable tool in order to easily build and
analyze the models for this forecasting problem analysis. It is based on [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) API for the sake of applying software engineering best practices to data and machine-learning pipelines. [MLflow tracking](https://mlflow.org/) is used to record and query experiments (code, data, config, and results).
